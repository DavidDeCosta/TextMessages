Initialization and Dependencies
Importing Libraries: The program begins by importing required libraries for sending emails, handling JSON files, and creating a graphical 
user interface (GUI).
Importing Provider Information: The program imports the PROVIDERS variable, which likely contains mappings between mobile carriers 
and their corresponding email addresses used for sending SMS/MMS.

Opt-Out List Management
Updating Opt-Out List: update_opt_out_list reads the opt_out_list.json file, which contains a list of phone numbers 
that have opted out of receiving messages. If the file is improperly formatted, it initializes an empty list. It then adds a new 
number to the list and writes the updated list back to the file.

Processing Opt-Out Emails
Processing Opt-Out Requests: process_opt_out_emails logs into an email server (Gmail in this case), looks for unread messages 
in the inbox, and checks for the word "STOP" in the email body. If found, it extracts the phone number from the sender's email 
address and adds it to the opt-out list.

Sending SMS/MMS via Email
Sending SMS: send_sms_via_email constructs an email with the content of the SMS, the recipient's email address formatted 
with the carrier's email domain, and then sends the email using the provided SMTP server and credentials.
Sending MMS: send_mms_via_email is similar to the above but includes an attachment (like an image) in the email to send a multimedia message.

Bulk Messaging
Sending Messages to Multiple Recipients: send_all_messages reads the opt-out list and then iterates through a 
list of phone numbers and providers. If the number hasn't opted out, it sends either an SMS or MMS message depending on 
whether a file path for an attachment is provided.

GUI for User Interaction
Image Selection: select_image opens a file dialog allowing the user to select an image file, updating a label with the file path.
Sending Messages: send_messages gathers user input for the subject, description, and file path from the GUI, and then 
calls send_all_messages to send the messages.
GUI Initialization: The code sets up the GUI with buttons, labels, text entry fields, and text areas to provide an 
interface for the user to input message details and initiate the sending process.

Execution Flow
The user may run the program, input message details in the GUI, and send messages to a list of recipients.
Separately, process_opt_out_emails can be run periodically or on a schedule to process opt-out requests from recipients.

Considerations
Security and Privacy: Handling email credentials and user phone numbers requires careful consideration of security and privacy best practices.
Provider Configuration: The email-to-SMS/MMS mapping relies on specific configurations for each mobile carrier, 
usually handled in the PROVIDERS variable.
Rate Limiting: Sending many emails in a short time may hit rate limits from the email provider.
The code leverages email-to-SMS/MMS gateways provided by mobile carriers, allowing text and multimedia messages 
to be sent via standard email protocols, and then converts them to SMS or MMS messages for delivery to the recipient's 
mobile device. It also monitors for opt-out requests, allowing recipients to stop receiving messages.
